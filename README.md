# Pre-Security

A structured repository documenting my foundational studies in cybersecurity, networking, and operating systems.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to build a strong technical foundation before moving into defensive security specialization.

It focuses on understanding how systems and networks operate at a fundamental level, which is essential for effective security analysis.


## Covered Topics

### Networking Fundamentals
- TCP/IP model
- OSI model
- IP addressing and subnetting
- ARP, DHCP, DNS
- Ports and protocols
- Routing basics

### Windows Fundamentals
- System tools (msinfo32, resmon, services)
- Event Viewer and logging
- Windows Registry
- Windows Security and Defender
- Firewall profiles
- BitLocker and TPM
- Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)

### Linux Fundamentals
- File system structure
- Permissions and ownership
- Process management
- Package management
- Basic networking commands


## Practical Focus

This repository includes:

- Structured notes
- Command explanations
- Security-focused observations
- Real command outputs from lab environments

## Why I´m Studying This?

Effective cybersecurity requires a deep understanding of:

- How operating systems manage processes and memory
- How network communication flows
- How services interact with the system
- How logging and monitoring work
